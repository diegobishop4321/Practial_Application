# Practial_Application
The aim of this investigation was to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not, using data analysis techniques. The project involves a guided analysis of how different variables such as the education level, type of passengers, income level, age and occupation of the customer affect the coupon acceptance rate for both bars and cheap restaurants. 

In general, the findings include the following trends: higher education levels tend to have a higher coupon acceptance, lower income levels are correlated with more coupon acceptance, fewer passengers with the customer lead to a higher acceptance rate and fewer visits to the location correlate with higher acceptance of the coupon.
